This was my web development class final project. The goal was to create a functioning order page that 
transfers order details to the shopping cart page.
For this project I only did the following:
1. Wrote all the JavaScript in co_cart.js and linked it to co_cart.html
2. In co_credit.js, I wrote all the js up until where it says "Functions already provided in the file"
3. Linked co_credit.js to co_credit.html
4. Added some custom css to the base layout css file
