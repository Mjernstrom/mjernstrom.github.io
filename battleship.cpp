//  Excited about this one; going to implement intelligent AI
//  Planning on allowing bot to remember every other miss made to make it more difficult for the player
//  My plan for the AI is to follow simple battleship logic. If the bot hits one of your ships spots, it turns on what I call "hit mode"
//  The bot stores all memory of turns with missed spots adjacent to a hit spot
//  So the bot will choose to hit another adjacent spot on it's next turn, and not choosing the previously missed spot
//  Once the bot sinks your ship, "hit mode" is turned off.
